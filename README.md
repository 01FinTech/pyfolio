QuantRisk
=========

QuantRisk is a Python library for performance and risk analysis of financial portfolios. It works well with the Zipline open source backtesting library.

For development, run `python setup.py develop` and edit the library files directly. Make sure to reload or restart the IPython kernel when you make changes.
